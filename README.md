# fantasy-ssbm
A website to manage SSBM fantasy leagues. Much of the inspiration for layout and formatting was drawn from my experience with UC Berkeley's UPE site. Furthermore, the [FlipClock API](http://flipclockjs.com/) was used to create the countdown timer on the main page. 

It's under development right now, but you can view the public site-in-progress [here](http://fantasy-ssbm.appspot.com)! This site is powered by the Django web framework.

Here is a visual of the website's home screen (**outdated**):
